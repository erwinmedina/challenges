# Challenges

## Introduction
This is where I add my coding challenges that I've worked on that day. I'm just trying to improve my skills so I'm writing out explanations for everything I do and when I'm stumped, I'll ask GPT to help clarify and walk me through it. I do give it my best first attempt though. But ultimately my goal is to see what the optimal approach is for a problem and try to familarize myself with it so that I can approach other problems the same way while also improving my current approach.

Currently, I've only worked on LeetCode. So my file structure has it broken down into easy and medium problems (not sure if i'll get around to hard!). Maybe at some point i'll transition to other coding challenge sites and i'll adjust accordingly.

## Languages / Testing
